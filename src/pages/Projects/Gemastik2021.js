                                <ProjectParagraph>Twing is a mobile application that aims to increase people’s awareness of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) and prevent it from happening. It helps people to stay productive by reducing the unnoticed side-effect of CVS. It generates real-time analytics and suggestions of its user’s behaviour while using the phone.</ProjectParagraph>
                                <ProjectParagraph>Twing was designed when my two friends and I were in a competition called GEMASTIK in 2021. It’s a national IT competition held annually by Indonesia’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology for university students. Our team was selected as the top 20 teams out of more than 700 teams in the UX Design category.</ProjectParagraph>

                                    <ProjectMainPoints>Our team identified the problem of users’ behaviour regarding increased phone usage from surveys and interviews.</ProjectMainPoints>
                                    <ProjectParagraph>The problem emerged after noticing that people’s intensity on the phone had increased significantly in the past few years, primarily because of the Covid-19 pandemic. If previously people used more time on their phones for entertainment purposes, they now need more time to work or communicate. Because of that, people are becoming more at risk of getting CVS, one of the most common health problems people might get due to high screen time that affects their productivity on their phones.</ProjectParagraph>
                                    <ProjectParagraph>We conducted an online survey of 175 random Indonesians to know their behaviour when using their phones. Our main reason for conducting this survey was to validate our assumptions about high screen time and people experiencing CVS. It turned out that our assumptions were valid. You can see the result from the image below.</ProjectParagraph>

                                    <ProjectParagraph>After the survey, we conducted several interviews with ten people to deepen our understanding of the problem. From the interview, we learned that one of the most common reasons people keep experiencing CVS is that they lack consciousness when using their phones, mainly when they open social media or entertainment-related applications. This lack of consciousness leads to increased screen time and, not infrequently, bad postures, leading to CVS.</ProjectParagraph>

                                    <ProjectParagraph>The User-Centered Design methodology was used to guide us through the design process. We tried to keep users’ participation as an essential part of the journey to match their needs and fulfil their expectations. To do that, we used several frameworks to help us throughout the whole process, including tree testing, card sorting, usability testing, and SUS questionnaires.</ProjectParagraph>

We chose these problems because they were the ones that aligned with our mission, which was to help the users solve their problems themselves since CVS has always been about digital users’ behaviour. These problems include:</ProjectParagraph>

                                        <ProjectListItem>People often lose track of time when using their phones.</ProjectListItem>

                                    <ProjectParagraph>After we sorted the problems, we mapped our solutions into them. We did this by comparing our solutions with the existing ones and their limitations. After several brainstorming sessions and a lot of “How Might We?”s, we decided to go forth with these solutions:</ProjectParagraph>

                                    <ProjectMainPoints>Our solution was to develop an integrated notification system that would notify users if they didn’t use their phones properly. Users and experts from different fields helped us to evaluate this solution.</ProjectMainPoints>
                                    <ProjectParagraph>Based on our previous findings, we decided to develop a solution to help people maintain their awareness when using their phones. The solution was implemented with an integrated notification system that came with the application. The system will notify the user at a certain time and conditions, precisely when the phone isn’t being used properly (according to health recommendations for CVS prevention). The conditions include such factors as viewing distance, brightness contrast, time off from phone, etc.</ProjectParagraph>

                                    <ProjectParagraph>Finally, we evaluated our solution using usability testing for ten people from both personas. We also gathered feedback from three experts from different fields of study that correspond with our solution, including a UX researcher, an ophthalmologist, and a psychologist. The evaluation process was conducted two times, in the first and second iteration.</ProjectParagraph>

Knowing what to put and what not to put into the design is necessary.</ProjectListItem>
                                        <ProjectListItem><ListSpan>Assumptions must be validated</ListSpan> (or at least supported). We did a lot of brainstorming throughout the journey, resulting in many assumptions about the solution, which we thought was perfect for the user. That kind of thought could lead to biases.</ProjectListItem>
                                        <ProjectListItem><ListSpan>Think in the present.</ListSpan> However, we didn’t. We thought that ideas were everything that mattered in designing a product. In reality, not all ideas could be implemented (yet) because of technological limitations. Thinking in the present and knowing the technology that we’ll use are mandatory in product design.</ProjectListItem>
